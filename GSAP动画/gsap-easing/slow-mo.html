        <p>SlowMo is a configurable ease that produces a slow-motion effect that decelerates initially, then moves
            linearly for a certain portion of the ease (which you can choose) and then accelerates again at the end;
            it's great for effects like zooming text onto the screen, smoothly moving it long enough for people to read
            it, and then zooming it off the screen. </p>

        <p>
            Without SlowMo, animators would often try to get the same effect by sequencing 3 tweens, one with an ease
            .out, then another with no ease (ease: "none"), and finally an ease .in. But the problem was that the eases
            didn't smoothly transition into one another so you'd see sudden shifts in velocity at the joints. SlowMo
            solves this problem and gives you complete control over how strong the eases are on each end and what
            portion of the movement in the middle is linear.</p>

        <p>
            The first parameter, linearRatio, determines the proportion of the ease during which the rate of change will
            be linear (steady pace). This should be a number between 0 and 1. For example, 0.5 would be half, so the
            first 25% of the ease would be easing out (decelerating), then 50% would be linear, then the final 25% would
            be easing in (accelerating). If you choose 0.8, that would mean 80% of the ease would be linear, leaving 10%
            on each end to ease. The default is 0.7.</p>

        <p>
            The second parameter, power, determines the strength of the ease at each end. If you define a value greater
            than 1, it will actually reverse the linear portion in the middle which can create interesting effects. The
            default is 0.7.</p>

        <p>
            The third parameter, yoyoMode, provides an easy way to create companion tweens that sync with normal SlowMo
            tweens. For example, let's say you have a SlowMo tween that is zooming some text onto the screen and moving
            it linearly for a while and then zooming off, but you want to tween that alpha of the text at the beginning
            and end of the positional tween. Normally, you'd need to create 2 separate alpha tweens, 1 for the fade-in
            at the beginning and 1 for the fade-out at the end and you'd need to calculate their durations manually to
            ensure that they finish fading in by the time the linear motion begins and then they start fading out at the
            end right when the linear motion completes. But to make this whole process much easier, all you'd need to do
            is create a separate tween for the alpha and use the same duration but a SlowMo ease that has its yoyoMode
            parameter set to true.

    gsap.registerPlugin(EasePack);

    //use the default SlowMo ease (linearRatio of 0.7 and power of 0.7)
    // slow第一个参数是linearRatio, 第二个参数是power 默认都是0.7
    gsap.to('#text1', { duration: 5, x: 600, ease: "slow" });

    // 理解：slow(0.5, 0.8) 第一个参数是linearRatio, 第二个参数是power，0.5 代表着有50%时间是线性的，然后25%开头是减速，25%结尾是加速

    //this gives the exact same effect as the line above, but uses a different syntax
    gsap.to('#text2', { duration: 5, x: 600, ease: "slow(0.5, 0.8)" });
    gsap.to('#text2_p0', { duration: 5, x: 600, ease: "slow(0.5, 0)" });
    gsap.to('#text2_p1', { duration: 5, x: 600, ease: "slow(0.5, 1)" });
    gsap.to('#text2_p2', { duration: 5, x: 600, ease: "slow(0.5, 1.8)" });
    //now let's create an opacity tween that syncs with the above positional tween, fading it in at the beginning and out at the end
    // 理解：yoyoMode: true 代表着是反向的效果
    gsap.from('#text3', { duration: 5, x: 100, opacity: 0, ease: "slow(0.5, 0.8, true)" });
    gsap.to('#text3_1', { duration: 5, x: 100, opacity: 0, ease: "slow(0.5, 0.8, true)" });
